    quote: The expansion is generous and makes this accommodate a WHOLE LOT of
      stuff. The chest strap keeps even a heavy load stable. There are many
      pockets of different sizes and shapes, plus a water bottle holder. When I
      got caught in a sudden cloud burst, the clothing, book, and cell phone
      inside it stayed nice and dry. I am NOT the typical user ... I do not do
      serious hiking. I am a senior citizen with two bad knees, and I get around
      well with two canes. Aquatherapy helps, so I use this to tote wet beach
      towels, water bottle, water shoes, sun block, etc.

    quote: We are able to fit a multitude of items in it with no problem (heavy and
      light). All together, the items make 50lbs. The bag has been carried
      around and tested without any problems occurring. If more weight was
      needed to be added, we are positive that this bag could handle it.
